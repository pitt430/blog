A Sprint Retrospective is a vehicle to drive change.  It is a chance to highlight opportunities for change, generate meaningful process improvements and ultimately move the team in the right direction.  It is not a platform for the loudest voice to gripe about something in the project without suggestions to make things better.  Retrospectives should invite constructive feedback on what could go better in future sprints, but it should never support hostility, baseless negativity, and finger-pointing.

## Summary

The Sprint Retrospective should create a safe space for the scrum team to share their honest feedback on whats going well, what could be improved and generate a discussion around things that should change next time around - with actionable items documented.

## Benefits

- It creates a safe, blameless space for team members to share their valuable feedback.
- It allows the team to document wins and areas of opportunity.
- It provides an actionable list of next steps and identifies who’s owning which item.
- It identifies small, incremental changes that can lead to larger waves of improvement.
- It allows teams to iterate on their process to amplify results.
- It allows opinions to be heard.
- It helps the team mature.
- It makes each sprint better than the last.

## Conclusion

The Sprint Retrospective is where the team reflects on the work they just completed, offers up kudos to what went well, and identifies suggestions for improvement moving forward. It should be action-oriented, blameless, and adapted to fit the team’s needs. It is facilitated by the Scrum Master. People on the periphery of the project do not need to – and should not – join
